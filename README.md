# COMP90082-AT


AT-wombat is a pure python package for extracting params from DICOM files. 
It was made for extracting and validating DICOM data in an easy "pythonic" way.  


Until current,
I define one extractGantryAngle(file_path) function which is used to extract all Gantry Angle.

also, this file depend on pydicom package,
if you want invoke this function, 
please pip install pydicom first.
